## why S6-rc

- heavyweight daemons could consume cpu, mem, disk resources and increase the total booting time significantly.
- start/stop order matters, handle oneshot and longrun daemon interleave.
- daemons need dependency management.

## Traditional, sequential starters

## Monolithic Init

- Upstart: used ptrace on the processes it spawned in order to keep track of their forks.
- launched: uses XML for daemon configuration, has to link in a XML parsing library.
- systemd: up by an order of magnitude, doesn't even get readiness notification right.
